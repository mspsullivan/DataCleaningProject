# DataCleaningProject
Course project for data cleaning class
The assignment is to take the data and perform the five steps.
Loading the data and making it tidy is documented in the code.

The data set is tidy.
There is one row for each observation. There is not one row for each
person, but that is ok, since there is one row for each observation.
If needed, the data can be reworked to answer any questions that come up
based on persons.

Setting the meaningful labels took some time to figure out.
I needed to look at all of the data in all of the files. 
Eventually, that made sense.

This directory contains 4 files for the project:
## File List
1. README.md this file
2. codebook.txt : This describes each of the files and transforms
3. run_analysis.R: Code to do all of the transforms
4. tidyData.txt:  The result data after all of the transforms in a text formet.
