X_test.txt, X_train.txt : This has 561 columns of activity measurements
subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt: this has the subject ID for each row of the data set
y_test.txt, y_train.txt: This has the activityCode for each row of the data set

activity_labels.txt: Use this to convert the activityCodes to friendly activity labels

The Plan:
load up the test files with 561 columns
tack on the subject column and tack on the 'activity' column.
Note that the 'activity' column will come from a lookup of the activity label.

Next, clean up the labels by swapping the 't' for 'time'.
Swap the 'f' for 'Fourier' and remove the extra '.' characters.
That will make the labels more readable.

The final data should just have a few columns for each row. There will be a few rows for each subject. One row each for STANDING, WALKING and the other activities.
