Project Code Book
The following files are provided:
test/X_test.txt
test/subject_test.txt
test/y_test.txt
train/X_train.txt
train/subject_train.txt
train/y_train.txt
activity_labels.txt
features.txt
##
##
## The code book will work like this:
## show what is in each file
## show how that file will feed into the final data set
X_test.txt, X_test.txt :             this has 561 columns of activity measurements
subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt: this has the subject ID for each row of the data set
y_test.txt, y_train.txt:             this has the activityCode for each row of the data set

activity_labels.txt: Use this to convert the activityCodes to friendly activity labels

The Plan:
load up the test files with 561 columns
tack on the subject column and tack on the 'activity' column.
Note that the 'activity' column will come from a lookup of the activity label.

That's it, the final data set should look like this:
66 columns of stds and means, subjectID, activity
